        <img src="images/porglets.png" alt="porglets" title="porglets" />
        <p>Porgs are a species of sea-dwelling bird. They are nativeto the planet Ahch-To, where
          Jedi Master Luke Skywalker made his exile in the year prior to the Battle of Crait.
          Porgs understand some languages. When they overheard Rey refer to Chewbacca as "Chewie"
          they mistook it be the word chewy leading them to wonder whether Chewbacca would serve
          as her food.
          They are curious throughout the islands of the planet Ahch-To. They were capable of diving to fetch
          fish and feed their offspring "porglets."
          Porgs exhibited a roosting behavior, and they built nests along the island cliffs.[1] They built nests from hair, fiber or grass and decorated them with shiny objects they had acquired.[5] Porgs loved water, both to drink and to play in. They also loved tasting new things.[5] Porgs had strong natural camouflaging abilities,[6] as well as many interesting calls, ranging from burbles to squeaks to song.[5] They crooned a special song when they were pleased. However, they could also be completely silent when necessary. Despite their curious nature, they could be quite shy if they felt threatened. Porgs, both wild and domesticated alike, were unusually smitten by human objects, and found shiny objects very fascinating. If their curiosity ran unchecked, they could wreak havoc. Porgs enjoyed being petted and scratched, especially behind their ears.

          on the drive there.
